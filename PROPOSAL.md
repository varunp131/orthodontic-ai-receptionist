# Upwork Proposal: AI Receptionist Development for Orthodontic Practice

## Opening

Hi [Client Name],

I'd love to help you build this AI voice receptionist system for your orthodontic clinic. I understand you need a seamless integration between Vapi and Dolphin Management to handle appointment booking, rescheduling, FAQs, and staff escalations.

## My Approach

**Phase 1: Discovery & Setup (Week 1)**
- Review Dolphin Management API documentation and authentication
- Set up Vapi account and test voice agent configuration
- Create development environment with secure API handling
- Map out all required data flows between systems

**Phase 2: Core Integration (Weeks 2-4)**
- Build middleware server (Node.js/Python) to connect Vapi ↔ Dolphin
- Implement appointment booking logic with availability checks
- Develop rescheduling and cancellation workflows
- Create FAQ knowledge base with practice information

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)**
- Implement intelligent escalation logic
- Add error handling and fallback scenarios
- Set up logging and monitoring
- Test with various call scenarios

**Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Weeks 7-8)**
- End-to-end testing with real clinic data
- Refine conversation flows based on testing
- Optimize response times
- Documentation and handoff

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or Python with FastAPI)
- **Vapi Integration**: Webhooks and function calling
- **Dolphin API**: RESTful API integration with proper authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for logging and analytics (optional)
- **Hosting**: AWS/Heroku/Railway for reliability

## Key Considerations I'll Address

1. **Dolphin API Access**: I'll need API credentials and documentation to begin. If Dolphin has limited API documentation, I'll work directly with their support.

2. **Data Security**: Patient information requires HIPAA-compliant handling - I'll ensure secure data transmission and storage.

3. **Conversation Quality**: I'll craft prompts that sound natural and handle edge cases gracefully.

4. **Escalation Triggers**: We'll define clear scenarios when the AI should transfer to staff (complex requests, emergencies, patient frustration, etc.).

## Questions for You

1. Do you have Dolphin API documentation and credentials ready?
2. What are your clinic's operating hours for the AI to reference?
3. Do you have a list of your most common FAQs?
4. What's your preferred escalation method (transfer call, SMS, email to staff)?

## Timeline & Budget

I estimate **8 weeks** at **15-20 hours/week** = 120-160 total hours.

At your budget range ($30-50/hr), this project would be **$3,600-$8,000** total.

I'm comfortable starting at **$35/hour** and can be flexible based on project scope.

## Why Choose Me

- Clear, structured approach to complex integrations
- Strong focus on healthcare data security
- Regular communication and progress updates
- Thorough testing before deployment
- Documentation for future maintenance

I'm excited about this project and confident I can deliver a reliable AI receptionist that improves your clinic's efficiency.

When can we schedule a call to discuss the Dolphin API access and next steps?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
